## Getting Started ðŸš€
To quickly get started make sure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) and do the following:
- Run `make build` to build the Docker container
- Run `make jupyter` to serve the Jupyter notebooks in `localhost:8888` 
- Open [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) in your browser and navigate to the notebook you want in the `notebooks/` folder
> Make sure you copy the full Jupyter token printed in the terminal
